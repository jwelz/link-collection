Comment: *I love seeing people with 10/20+ years experience still messing around and... messing up. It gives me hope that maybe some day, I too will mess up with such grace and so much knowledge in the back of my head :D I'm on much lower level and more in C, rather than C++ but I'll get there, with your help maybe sooner! :) Thanks for this videos, great guest, great topic, awesome channel :)*
